> Historical manual test notes, not a current test report. Use
> [Testing Guide](docs/TESTING.md) for current automated checks. Emoji mappings
> do not establish validated sign-language translation.

## Quick Test Steps

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
python backend/main.py
```

### 2. Open Frontend
Open `frontend/dashboard.html` in your browser (or use Live Server)

### 3. Login
Use your existing credentials to login

### 4. Test Non-Verbal to Verbal Mode

**Start Simulation:**
- Click "Start Simulation"

**Test Greetings (now using 🙋):**
- Click "🙋 Hello/Hi" button
  - Expected: "Hello! It's great to see you today!"
- Click "☀️🙋 Good Morning" button
  - Expected: "Good morning! I hope you're ready for a great day!"
- Click "🌤️🙋 Good Afternoon" button
  - Expected: "Good afternoon! How has your day been so far?"
- Click "🌙🙋 Good Night" button
  - Expected: "Good night! Sleep well and see you tomorrow!"

**Test Goodbye (still using 👋):**
- Click "👋✌️ Goodbye" button
  - Expected: "Goodbye! Have a wonderful rest of your day!"

**Test No (now distinct with 👎):**
- Click "👎 No" button
  - Expected: "I understand. Let's try a different approach."

### 5. Test Verbal to Non-Verbal Mode

**Switch Mode:**
- Click "🗣️ → 👤 Verbal to Non-Verbal" button

**Test Phrase Translation:**
- Type or select "Hello" from common phrases
  - Expected translation: 🙋
- Type or select "Good morning"
  - Expected translation: ☀️🙋
- Type or select "Good afternoon"
  - Expected translation: 🌤️🙋
- Type or select "Good night"
  - Expected translation: 🌙🙋
- Type or select "Goodbye"
  - Expected translation: 👋✌️

### 6. Verify Conversation History

**Check that:**
- All messages persist when switching between modes
- Greeting emojis display correctly (🙋 for hello, 👋 for goodbye)
- No confusion between "Hi" and "No" gestures

## Expected Behavior Summary

| Gesture | Emoji | Meaning | Response |
|---------|-------|---------|----------|
| Hello/Hi | 🙋 | Hand raised greeting | "Hello! It's great to see you today!" |
| Good Morning | ☀️🙋 | Sun + hand raised | "Good morning! I hope you're ready for a great day!" |
| Good Afternoon | 🌤️🙋 | Partly cloudy + hand raised | "Good afternoon! How has your day been so far?" |
| Good Night | 🌙🙋 | Moon + hand raised | "Good night! Sleep well and see you tomorrow!" |
| Goodbye | 👋✌️ | Wave + peace sign | "Goodbye! Have a wonderful rest of your day!" |
| No | 👎 | Thumbs down | "I understand. Let's try a different approach." |
| Raise Hand | 🙋 | Hand raised | "I see you need help. What can I do for you?" |

## Troubleshooting

**If emojis don't display correctly:**
- Make sure your browser supports UTF-8 encoding
- Try Chrome, Firefox, or Edge (latest versions)
- Clear browser cache and reload

**If responses don't match:**
- Check backend console for errors
- Verify backend is running on http://localhost:8000
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

**If translation doesn't work:**
- Verify you're in the correct mode
- Check that ASL_MAPPINGS in app.js has the updated values
- Restart the backend if needed

## Success Criteria

✅ "Hi/Hello" uses 🙋 (not 👋)
✅ "No" uses 👎 (distinct from greetings)
✅ "Goodbye" still uses 👋✌️
✅ All greeting variations use 🙋 consistently
✅ Backend recognizes and responds correctly to 🙋
✅ Verbal-to-Non-Verbal translation works with new emojis
✅ Conversation history persists across mode switches
✅ No emoji encoding issues in the UI
