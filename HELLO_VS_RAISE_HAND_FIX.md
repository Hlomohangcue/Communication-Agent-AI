# Hello/Hi vs Raise Hand Fix - Complete ✅

## Issue Resolved
Hello/Hi and Raise Hand now use different emojis and give different responses.

---

## Problem

Both "Hello/Hi" and "Raise Hand" were using the same 🙋 emoji, causing them to give the same response.

**Before:**
- Hello/Hi button: 🙋 → "Hello! It's great to see you today!"
- Raise Hand button: 🙋 → "Hello! It's great to see you today!" ❌ (same response)

---

## Solution

Changed the emoji assignments:
- **Greetings** now use 👋 (wave emoji)
- **Raise Hand** keeps 🙋 (person raising hand emoji)

**After:**
- Hello/Hi button: 👋 → "Hello! It's great to see you today!" ✅
- Raise Hand button: 🙋 → "I see you need help. What can I do for you?" ✅ (different!)

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend - dashboard.html

**Greetings now use 👋 (wave):**
```html
<button type="button" class="token-btn" data-token="👋">👋 Hello/Hi</button>
<button type="button" class="token-btn" data-token="☀️👋">☀️👋 Good Morning</button>
<button type="button" class="token-btn" data-token="🌤️👋">🌤️👋 Good Afternoon</button>
<button type="button" class="token-btn" data-token="🌙👋">🌙👋 Good Night</button>
<button type="button" class="token-btn" data-token="👋✌️">👋✌️ Goodbye</button>
```

**Raise Hand keeps 🙋:**
```html
<button type="button" class="token-btn" data-token="🙋">🙋 Raise Hand</button>
```

### 2. Frontend - app.js

**Updated ASL_MAPPINGS:**
```javascript
const ASL_MAPPINGS = {
    // Greetings (now use 👋)
    'hello': '👋',
    'hi': '👋',
    'good morning': '☀️👋',
    'good afternoon': '🌤️👋',
    'good night': '🌙👋',
    'goodbye': '👋✌️',
    
    // Raise hand (uses 🙋)
    'raise hand': '🙋',
    'raise your hand': '🙋',
    // ...
}
```

### 3. Backend - speech_agent.py

**Updated greeting detection:**
```python
# Greetings (using 👋 wave emoji)
if "👋" in semantic_meaning and "☀️" in semantic_meaning:
    text = "Good morning! I hope you're ready for a great day!"
elif "👋" in semantic_meaning and "🌤️" in semantic_meaning:
    text = "Good afternoon! How has your day been so far?"
elif "👋" in semantic_meaning and "🌙" in semantic_meaning:
    text = "Good night! Sleep well and see you tomorrow!"
elif "👋" in semantic_meaning and "✌️" in semantic_meaning:
    text = "Goodbye! Have a wonderful rest of your day!"
elif "👋" in semantic_meaning or "hello" in meaning_lower or "hi" in meaning_lower:
    text = "Hello! It's great to see you today!"

# Raise hand (using 🙋 emoji) - for getting attention/asking questions
elif "🙋" in semantic_meaning or "raise hand" in meaning_lower:
    text = "I see you need help. What can I do for you?"
```
