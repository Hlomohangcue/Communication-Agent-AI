# Bidirectional Communication Features

> Historical implementation note: this document is not a current capability or
> validation report. Its ASL-inspired gesture/translation wording does not
> establish ASL recognition or translation. The current system maps generic
> gestures and emoji; see [Current Features](docs/CURRENT_FEATURES.md) and
> [Limitations and Future Work](docs/LIMITATIONS_AND_FUTURE_WORK.md).
